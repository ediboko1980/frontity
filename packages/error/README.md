# `@frontity/error`

The Frontity warnings and errors.

This is somewhat modified from https://github.com/alexreardon/tiny-invariant and with added typescript.

## Usage

```js
import { warn, error } from "@frontity/error";

error(someCondition, "The condition `someCondition` has failed!");

warn("This should never happen! ðŸ˜œ");
```
